# Phase 1 Prototype - Glass Calendar

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Built

A fully functional web application demonstrating the hierarchical backlog calendar concept with beautiful glass-morphism design.

## âœ¨ Key Features Implemented

### 1. Hierarchical Backlog System
- **Year Backlog**: Broad annual goals and themes
- **Month Backlog**: Monthly objectives and major events  
- **Week Backlog**: Weekly priorities and tasks
- **Day Backlog**: Daily tasks and activities

### 2. Drag & Drop Interface
- Seamless movement between backlog levels
- Visual feedback during drag operations
- No time constraints until final scheduling
- Events inherit to appropriate lower levels

### 3. Glass-Morphism Design
- Modern translucent UI elements
- Beautiful depth and layering effects
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Smooth animations and transitions

### 4. Event Management
- Create events at any hierarchy level
- Edit event details inline
- Delete events with confirmation
- Visual indicators for event types

### 5. Data Persistence
- Local storage using Zustand
- Automatic state persistence
- No backend required for Phase 1

## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with custom glass components
- **React Beautiful DnD** for drag and drop functionality
- **Zustand** for lightweight state management
- **Date-fns** for date manipulation
- **Lucide React** for beautiful icons

### Architecture
- **Component-based** architecture with reusable UI components
- **Store-based** state management with persistence
- **Type-safe** development with TypeScript
- **Responsive** design with mobile-first approach

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Components

### GlassCard
- Reusable glass-morphism card component
- Hover effects and smooth transitions
- Customizable styling and interactions

### EventCard
- Displays event information with appropriate icons
- Color-coded by hierarchy level
- Edit and delete actions
- Drag handle for reordering

### BacklogColumn
- Drop zones for each hierarchy level
- Visual feedback for drag operations
- Empty state with helpful instructions
- Add new events functionality

### CalendarView
- Main application container
- Drag and drop context provider
- Header with current date information
- Instructions for users

## ðŸ“± User Experience

### Workflow
1. **Start High**: Begin with year-level goals
2. **Break Down**: Move to month, week, day levels
3. **Add Detail**: Assign specific times when ready
4. **Stay Flexible**: Move events between levels as needed

### Visual Design
- **Gradient Background**: Purple to blue gradient
- **Glass Effects**: Translucent cards with backdrop blur
- **Color Coding**: Different colors for each hierarchy level
- **Smooth Animations**: Hover effects and transitions
